# 🎬 Early Animation Project — Reflection & Creative Significance

This short animation was created during my Fine Arts – Computer Graphics (Animation) program at NYIT. Although it began as a simple classroom exercise, it ended up revealing the way I naturally create and interpret visual storytelling.

## 🎥 Project Context
The class provided us with the base dog model and guided us through the initial rigging and animation steps. After that, each student was required to create a **short animation sequence** demonstrating:

- basic character movement  
- simple emotional expression  
- a micro-narrative  

While the assignment emphasized minimalism, my instinct was to create a scene with emotional tone, symbolic progression, and subtle narrative depth.

## ✨ What This Project Taught Me

### **1. I animate from emotion before mechanics.**  
The dog’s movement wasn’t just literal — it conveyed curiosity, mood, and softness. This showed me that my first instinct is *emotional storytelling*, not technical precision alone.

### **2. My mind creates in layers, even when the assignment is simple.**  
While minimalism was encouraged, I naturally constructed:

- atmosphere  
- mood shifts  
- small symbolic moments  

This reflects a culturally rich, narrative-driven style.

### **3. The technical foundations were strong.**  
Even as a beginner, I learned:

- anticipation  
- weight and timing  
- secondary motion  
- character consistency  

These fundamentals now connect to my modern creative tools, including AI-assisted projects.

### **4. This project foreshadowed my artistic identity.**  
Today, my creative work blends:

- emotional storytelling  
- visual symbolism  
- reflective writing  
- AI-enhanced design  

This animation was the earliest expression of that multidimensional voice.
