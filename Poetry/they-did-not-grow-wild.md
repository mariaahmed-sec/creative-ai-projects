## ✨ Poem

They grew through quiet structure—  
through rhythms whispered while others shouted,  
through love tucked between  
laundry piles and late-night fears.

Others caused earthquakes—  
rattled their walls, broke our days apart.  
But we rebuilt. Again and again.  
With bruised hands and tired grace.

They fell. I fell.  
We rose—not polished, but whole.  
The scars remain,  
but so does the strength.

They shout, scream, test,  
but they carry heart like fire—  
burning loyal in the moments that matter,  
soft in ways only I get to see.

**They did not grow by themselves.**
