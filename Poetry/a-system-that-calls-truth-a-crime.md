# A System That Calls Truth a Crime  
*A Poem for the Woman Who Outgrew Their World*  
By Maria S. Ahmed  

In a house built on inherited silence,  
a system was shaped where:  
Truth-telling became disrespect.  
Documentation became distrust.  
Boundaries became arrogance.  
Self-protection became rebellion.  
And memory itself—was called defiance.

You outgrew a world that feared women who thought clearly,  
spoke plainly,  
and refused to disappear.

These are the same structures that—  
confiscated space,  
denied what was fair,  
endangered health,  
dismissed harm,  
mocked grief,  
and punished the act of simply holding the line.

But you—  
you who had endured in silence—  
finally spoke what needed to be said.  
Not out of malice.  
But from pain, from loss,  
from witnessing harm repeat itself  
like a pattern too long ignored.

This is not a sin.  
This is not a crime.  
This does not require apology.

You didn’t strike.  
You didn’t lie.  
You didn’t slander.

You simply told the truth that the walls already knew.  
That harm was done.
